==== Format Description ====

The trial data contains 4 files of each 500 sentences of the following language
combinations of L1 and L2 pairs: English-German, English-Spanish,
French-English, and Dutch-English.Participants are encouraged to participate in
as many of the four language pairs as possible, but may also choose any subset.
Each input sentence is written in the L2 language and a small fragment is
written in the L1 language. This fragment is labeled with <f>. 

For the trial data we also provide the correctly translated reference sentence
(<ref>) in which the fragment of the input sentence is given in the L2
language.

Here is an example of the French-English trial data:

	<sentencepairs L1="fr" L2="en">
		<s id="1">
  			<input>I <f id="1">voudrais savoir</f>  whether one can raise an objection of that kind to what is merely a report ,
  	 not a legislative proposal , and whether that is something I can competently do on Thursday .</input>
	  		<ref>I <f id="1">want to know</f>  whether one can raise an objection of that kind to what is merely a report , 
	  not a legislative proposal , and whether that is something I can competently do on Thursday .</ref>
		</s>
	....
	
	<s id="500">
  			<input>Transparency and openness mean - and this is my clear call - that we must <f id="1">appliquer</f>  the same yardstick to all the institutions .</input>
  			<ref>Transparency and openness mean - and this is my clear call - that we must <f id="1">apply</f>  the same yardstick to all the institutions .</ref>
		</s>
	</sentencepairs>
