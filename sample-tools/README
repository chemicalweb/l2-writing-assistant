    Tools & Python Library - Version 1.0


INSTALLATION
==============

System-wide installation:

$ sudo python ./setup.py install

Python usually defaults to Python 2, but you may also use Python 3:

$ sudo python3 ./setup.py install

If you obtain an import error then make sure the package python-setuptools is
installed in your distribution. You also need the package python-lxml. 

If you have no sudo-rights, then you can install the library locally
using the --prefix switch, make sure the target prefix is in your $PYTHONPATH.

TOOLS
==============

The following tools are included:


    semeval2014task5-setview  - This tool simply prints a set to standard output in a terminal, it takes one XML file as argument

    semeval2014task5-evaluate - This is the evaluation script for evaluating your system's output against the trial/test set.


EVALUATION
===========

The evaluation script should be run as follows:

$ semeval2014task5-evaluate --ref trialdata.xml --out systemout.xml

If you want additional Machine Translation evaluation metrics (BLEU, METEOR,
NIST,TER, WER, PER), you need to download the MT Evaluation Scripts from the
http://lst-science.ru.nl/~proycon/mtevalscripts.tar.gz and explicitly pass \
the path to where you decompressed those using --mtevaldir=/path/to/mtevalscripts .

For out-of-five mode you need to add the -a flag to take into account alternatives.

For case-insensitive scoring, add the -i flag. 

FORMAT LIBRARY
=====================

The semeval2014task5.format module enables you to easily read and write the XML
format for this task.  Import the format library in your Python source as
follows:

import libsemeval2014task5 format as format

An example system that shows the functionality of this library has been
implemented in example.py, which has been heavily commented. Please consult
this to learn how the library works. It implements a full system that
'translates' fragments to upper-case instead of doing actual translation from
L1 to L2.
