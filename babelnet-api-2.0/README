README - BabelNet API 2.0 (October 2013)

This package consists of a Java API to work with BabelNet, a very large
multilingual semantic network. For more information please refer to the
documentation below on how to install and run the software, as well as
our website (http://babelnet.org) and Google group
(http://groups.google.com/group/babelnet-group) for news, updates and
papers.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

We assume that you have a standard installation of the Sun Java 1.6 JDK
and all the associated programs (i.e., java, javac, etc.) in your path.

------------
INSTALLATION
------------

1. Download and configure the BabelNet Lucene indexes. The BabelNet API
relies on a set of Lucene indexes to access the knowledge base content,
so you need to install them before anything else.

Currently, we provide BabelNet as a semantic network consisting
of 50 languages (English, Catalan, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Afrikaans,
Arabic, Bulgarian, Czech, Welsh, Danish, Greek, Estonian, Persian, Finnish,
Irish, Hebrew, Hindi, Croatian, Hungarian, Indonesian, Icelandic, Japanese,
Korean, Lithuanian, Latvian, Malay, Dutch, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese,
Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Slovenian, Albanian, Serbian, Swedish, Swahili,
Tagalog, Turkish, Ukranian, Vietnamese, Chinese, Esperanto, Galician, Maltese,
Basque, Latin) and described in the papers below.
The indices for BabelNet are available here:

    http://lcl.uniroma1.it/babelnet/data/babelnet-2.0.0-core-lucene.tar.bz2

To start using BabelNet, first download the compressed indexes and
unpack them:

    # create the data dir
    mkdirhier ~/data/babelnet 
    cd ~/data/babelnet
    # get the data
    wget http://lcl.uniroma1.it/babelnet/data/babelnet-2.0.0-core-lucene.tar.bz2
    # unpack the archives
    tar xjvf babelnet-2.0.0-core-lucene.tar.bz2

Next, tell the API where to find BabelNet by setting the "babelnet.dir"
property in the config/babelnet.var.properties file. For instance,
assuming you unpacked BabelNet in the "/home/your_user/data/babelnet",
you simply need to write the following within "config/babelnet.var.properties":

    babelnet.dir=/home/your_user/data/babelnet

If your WordNet is not installed in the standard location 
(/usr/local/share/wordnet-3.0), please change the corresponding property
in the config/jlt.var.properties file:

# simply put /usr/local/share/wordnet
jlt.wordnetPrefix=/usr/local/share/wordnet

to the prefix of your WordNet path without the "-3.0" suffix. For instance,
if WordNet 3.0 is located in /opt/WordNet-3.0, you should change the property
to:

jlt.wordnetPrefix=/opt/WordNet

You are now ready to use the API. If you have Apache Ant installed, you
can test that everything works by simply issuing the "ant run-babelnetdemo"
command in the same directory where you found this README file (i.e.,
the root directory of the BabelNet API package). In alternative we also
provide a shell script (run-babelnetdemo.sh, make sure that the file is
executable or set it chmod +x run-babelnetdemo.sh). The next step is to look
at programmatic usage examples starting from the main method of the
"main" API class, namely it.uniroma1.lcl.babelnet.BabelNet.

IMPORTANT: please note that, in order to enable the log4j settings, you
have to add the config folder to your classpath. For instance:

java -classpath bin:lib/*:config it.uniroma1.lcl.babelnet.BabelNetDemo

Within an Eclipse project, right-click the config folder, select
"Build Path" and click "Use as Source Folder".

-------------
BABELNET DUMP
-------------

The data stored within the Lucene indexes are also available in a simple
text-based format. The BabelNet dump is available here:

    http://lcl.uniroma1.it/babelnet/data/babelnet-2.0.0-core-dump.bz2

Please refer to the papers below for details on the file format of the
BabelNet dump. We also provide a text file containing the Babel synsets'
glosses:

    http://lcl.uniroma1.it/babelnet/data/babelnet-2.0.0-glosses.bz2

The format of the file containing the multilingual glosses consists of a
set of lines for each Babel synset: the first line contains the synset
id, which is followed by a number of lines, each containing a gloss
together with its language and the Babel sense and region where it comes
from. Babel synsets are separated by empty lines.
