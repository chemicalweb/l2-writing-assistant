% THOUGHTS/QUESTIONS

1. When learners code-switch, are they more likely to do so in
   phrases, or do they have good amounts of word-for-word switches?

   - Hunch: the L2 is more likely to be word-for-word, so translating
     back to the L1 may be easier, in some sense.

2. When do we need to register?
   http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2014/index.php?id=registration-1

3. Which of these NUCLE errors are most important to analyze?  Would
   it make a difference as to what type of code-switching/error we
   have? (e.g., collocational vs. idiomatic vs. single-word?)

4. Similar questions for EFCAMDAT ...

5. How we can treat ourselves like a bilingual dictionary?  That is
   what learners are lacking, and that is our role (so to speak).  But
   there are complications to being a simple dictionary:

   a) there are many possible word/phrase senses

   b) learners may not know exactly what word/phrase they need in the
   L2, i.e., they may have misused some word or other (e.g., just
   because I say "run down" doesn't mean that's the phrase that's
   needed in the L2)

   c) there may be other errors in the context

   Q: would it help to view the dictionary as corrupt and perhaps to
   derive it, in part, from learner mistakes?  e.g., we could fake
   transfer errors and then use those to train some type of system?
